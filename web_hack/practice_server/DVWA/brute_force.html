    <h1>Brute Force attack</h1>
    <div>
      Brute Force attack is uses trial and error to crack passwords, login
      credentials, and encryption keys. It is simple yet reliable tactic for
      gaining unauthorized access to individual accounts and organizations'
      systems and networks. The chance gets extremely smaller if special and
      numeric characters are used and the length of password gets longer.
      <br />
      There are largely two types of brute force attack :
      <ol>
        <li>Alphabetic substitution</li>
        <p>
          Alphabetic substitution simply tries all possible candidates from a to
          z. (Special and numeric characters can be included)
        </p>
        <li>Dictionary attack</li>
        <p>
          Dictionary attack uses a file which contains a list of candidates.
          (The file could contain more than hundreds of thousands of candidates)
        </p>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Kali Linux (debian-based linux), Burp Suite(hacking program) and
      DVWA(server that is developed for hacking practice) were used for
      practice.
    </div>

      The code above shows how log-in algorithm works. Here, the code simply
      accepts 'username' and 'password' and send them to database to check if
      the user exists. But, it does not defend against brute force attack. In
      order to defend against the attack, we have to check the frequency of the
      log-in trial or generate session token to reject the packet coming through
      CSRF.

    <p>
      First, we need to find the log-in request on Burp Suite and send the
      request to intruder.

    <img src="brute_force_img/BFA(intruder-payload-option).png" width="30%" />
    <p>
      Move to 'Intruder' tab.
      <br />
      Set payload position($) on a password and playload type to 'Brute forcer'.
      Modify playload options and click 'start attack' button.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the attack is successful, the length of a request will differ from
      those of other requests.
